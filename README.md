# Process Images Macro Set

## What is it?
This is a macro set that we use to batch process images from various microscopes, usually multi-channels single-plane images or multi-channels z-stacks. It uses Bio-Formats for importing proprietary formats, and performs successive processing steps (projections, background subtraction, unsharp masking...). It is designed to be used on all images from an experiment, grouped in a single input folder. It ultimately provides unprocessed single-channel stacks for quantification, and a processed overlay hyperstack for exploring and visualizing the images.
